# Getting Started 
Part I of this book teaches you the basic concepts you’ll need to write Python programs. Many of these concepts are common to all programming languages, so they’ll be useful throughout your life as a programmer.

In **Chapter 1** you’ll install Python on your computer and run your first program, which prints the message *Hello world!* to the screen.

Setting Up ---

The first task is to install Python (or make sure we have an up-to-date version).

Python runs on all modern operating systems, but the setup process is slightly different on each operating system (OS). Please follow the link below based on your OS:

- [Linux](linux_setup.md)
- [OS X](osx_setup.md)
- [Windows](windows_setup.md)

TRY IT YOURSELF \#1
-------------------

The exercises in this chapter are exploratory. Starting in [Chapter 2](../chapter_02/README.md#ch02), the challenges you’ll solve will be based on what you’ve learned.

<span id="ch1exe1"></span>**1-1. python.org:** Explore the Python home page (*<http://python.org/>*) to find topics that interest you. As you become familiar with Python, different parts of the site will be more useful to you.

<span id="ch1exe2"></span>**1-2. Hello World Typos:** Open the [*hello_world.py*](hello_world.py) file you just created. Make a typo somewhere in the line and run the program again. Can you make a typo that generates an error? Can you make sense of the error message? Can you make a typo that doesn’t generate an error? Why do you think it didn’t make an error?

<span id="ch1exe3"></span>**1-3. Infinite Skills:** If you had infinite programming skills, what would you build? You’re about to learn how to program. If you have an end goal in mind, you’ll have an immediate use for your new skills; now is a great time to draft descriptions of what you’d like to create. It’s a good habit to keep an “ideas” notebook that you can refer to whenever you want to start a new project. Take a few minutes now to describe three programs you’d like to create.
